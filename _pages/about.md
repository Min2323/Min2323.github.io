Hello, I’m **Min Ho**, a PhD candidate in Biomedical Informatics at Ajou University School of Medicine, under the supervision of Prof. Rae Woong Park.

I majored in **life sciences and minored in computer science during my undergraduate studies**. At the time, I was fascinated by the idea of improving patient care through scientific innovation, and I dreamed of contributing to the development of new therapies. I believed that becoming a medical doctor would help me understand real-world clinical challenges and better connect scientific ideas with practical applications in patient care.

**In medical school**, I found meaning in caring for patients, but also became intrigued by the vast amount of data generated in hospitals. I realized that this data holds valuable information about patient. **This motivated me to explore how data could help to solve difficult clinical questions.** 

Driven by this interest, I began my research as a medical student. I evaluated treatment choices for atrial fibrillation in patients with comorbid obstructive lung disease, where **beta blockers are often avoided** due to their bronchoconstrictive effects. However, the result showed that **beta blockers were associated with better survival outcomes** compared to calcium channel blockers. These findings were subsequently published in **Heart Rhythm (2018)**.

This early research strengthened my interest in data-driven medicine and helped me decide to pursue a **PhD in biomedical informatics**. After choosing this field, I continued working on addressing real-world issues. During the initial stages of COVID 19 pandemic, when real time clinical data was scarce, my colleague and I rapidly collected and analyzed studies from various countries to conduct a **network meta-analysis on the efficacy and side effects of COVID-19 treatments**. This work, driven by a need to support frontline care, was published in **PLOS Medicine (2020)**.

From the perspective of developing new therapeutic strategies, I also explored the **hypothesis that 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARI), used for benign prostatic hyperplasia, might inhibit bladder cancer progression**. Using a nationwide bladder cancer cohort, I validated this at the population level, leading to a publication in **JAMA Network Open (2023)**. Recently, I went further by curating public single-cell data to understand the mechanistic basis of this association and observed increased expression of DHT synthesis-related enzymes in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Currently, I’m validating this through immunohistochemistry (IHC) by using patient samples in our hospital.

Beyond that, I collaborated with a **biotech venture on developing CAR-T therapies**, incorporating oncolytic viruses to prime tumors for targeted CAR T attacks, aiming to eliminate residual cancer cells. This work was published in **iScience (2024)**.

Currently, I am analyzing **single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data** to uncover mechanisms of treatment resistance in vitiligo patients. I proposed this project to the government and received a grant equivalent to **$170,000 over three years to support the ongoing research**. In parallel, I am using nationwide claims data to study heterogeneous treatment effects in atrial fibrillation patients on incidence of stroke.

In terms of data analysis, I have practical experience working with various types of data, including **claims data, electronic medical records (EMR), the UK Biobank, single-cell RNA sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics**. Through these experiences, I have come to understand the unique strengths and limitations of each data type, and how controlling for bias and exploring causality can lead to deeper insights into clinical and biological phenomena.

From my experiences with biological to patient-level, **I view these studies as preparing steps toward fusing multiple modalities.** Building on this, I aim to **integrate diverse data types, uncover causal relationships between variables, and achieve precision medicine that captures patients’ complexity.** Ultimately, I hope to support better, more personalized decisions in patient care.

**I hope to continue to learn and grow in this field, eager for more knowledge and guidance, so that these works can contribute to improving patient health**
